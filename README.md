# Full Stack AI with Python

## 00_python

This directory contains small, instructional Python examples used for learning and practice. The scripts are intentionally simple and some include mistakes to encourage debugging and hands-on exploration.

- **non_python_code.py**: A procedural example with a `make_chai()` function that demonstrates control flow and basic function calls (contains intentional syntax/logic errors to fix).
- **non_python_code_shop.py**: A minimal `Chai` class showing basic object-oriented patterns (constructor, methods, and instantiation).

How to use:

- Run individual scripts for practice, e.g. `python 00_python/non_python_code_shop.py`.
- Review and fix the included scripts to learn debugging, syntax rules, and Python conventions.

Contributing:

- Feel free to clean up these examples, add comments, or add corrected versions alongside the originals (use a `*_fixed.py` suffix to keep originals intact).
